## Relationship between Fish Shape & Weight (Multiple Linear Regression)

The goal of this study was to explore the correlation between fishes weight and their shape (height, width, length), using multiple linear regression to build a predictive model.

## CIFAR-10 Image Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network

The goal of this project is to create a basic CNN for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset across 10 different classes (such as animals and vehicles).

*CIFAR-10 is an image dataset from Tensorflow, more information below*

## Relationship between TV Sales & Advertising

The goal of this study was to explore the relationship between advertising expenditures and sales, using simple linear regression (SLR) to build a predictive model.
